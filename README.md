# AI/ML Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my step-by-step journey into AI/ML and Deep Learning, starting with Python and Pandas foundations and progressing into ERP-flavored projects.

## 📂 Structure
- **Day 1 Setup** – Environment installation and test notebook
- **Day 2 Basics** – Python + Pandas warm-up exercises
- **ERP Projects** – Realistic datasets (orders, invoices, shipments) applied to ML models
- **Deep Learning** – Intro notebooks with Keras/PyTorch

## 🎯 Goals
- Build strong foundations in Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn
- Apply ML concepts to ERP-style datasets
- Document each step clearly for learning and portfolio purposes
- Transition into deep learning and MLOps practices

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jcodipilly/erp-ml-projects.git
2. Open notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Follow along with documented steps and examples.   

✨ Notes
All notebooks are self-contained and include explanations in Markdown cells.
Datasets are either synthetic (ERP-style) or public open datasets.
This repo is part of my continuous learning journey into AI/ML and system architecture.
